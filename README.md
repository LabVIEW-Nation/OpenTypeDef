# Open TypeDef.
A tool enables a new Right Click Menu option on wires, constants & terminals to open the TypeDef control (.ctl) file of the data type.

This package adds a new Right-Click Menu (RCM) for the block diagram <b>Wires</b>, <b>Constants</b> & <b>Terminals</b> which carry either a <b>TypeDef</b> data or <b>Class Object</b> data.

This menu will be available in both edit & run modes.

When you are debugging some code and there is a wire/constant/terminal carrying typedef data or class object, this RCM would come in handy.
